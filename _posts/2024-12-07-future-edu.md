With two young children—one four years old and another just a few months old—I’ve been thinking a lot about the world they’ll grow up into. As someone working in AI and robotics research, I’m constantly reminded that the future of work will be vastly different. Tasks like writing contracts or editing spreadsheets might be handled entirely by AI systems before my kids even finish school. In that world, certain human qualities will matter more than ever. Here are the areas I’m focusing on as I think about how to prepare them for an uncertain but exciting future.

### Adaptability and Resilience
The pace of change can feel overwhelming, and it will only get faster. I want my kids to feel comfortable in shifting environments, to know that it’s okay when things don’t go as planned. If they can see each new challenge as a puzzle to solve rather than a roadblock, they’ll find it easier to thrive no matter what comes their way. Sometimes that means letting a block tower fall and talking about how to rebuild it, or helping them understand that not all days feel the same, and that’s perfectly normal.

### Critical Thinking and Complex Problem-Solving
AI can handle vast amounts of data, but deciding what’s important, what’s ethical, and what’s truly in our best interest is still a human strength. I encourage my older child to ask questions, to look at a problem from different angles, and not to stop at the first answer he finds. Whether it’s figuring out how to share a toy so both kids stay happy or exploring why certain things in nature happen the way they do, I’m trying to lay the groundwork for a flexible, questioning mind.

### Creativity and Original Expression
While AI can mimic patterns and styles, coming up with something truly new is still a human skill. I believe my children’s ability to imagine, create, and think differently will remain one of their greatest assets. I try to celebrate their inventive ideas—no matter how offbeat—so they understand that their unique contributions and wacky stories are valuable and worth expressing.

### Emotional Intelligence and Interpersonal Skills
Even the smartest machines can’t empathize. Understanding emotions, building trust, inspiring others—these are all things I see as essential in a future where humans and AI work side by side. I talk about feelings often, pointing out when one child is upset or when a kind gesture can help another person feel better. Teaching them to read social cues, communicate honestly, and care about others isn’t just good parenting—it’s preparing them for a world that still needs human warmth and understanding.

### Curiosity and Lifelong Learning
Information will get outdated quickly, but the desire to learn never will. I encourage my children’s questions and do my best to feed their curiosity. We read books, explore nature, and let them dig deeper into the topics they’re fascinated by, whether it’s dinosaurs, outer space, or how a vacuum cleaner works. By showing them that new discoveries are exciting, I hope they’ll carry that love of learning throughout their lives.

### Digital Literacy and Understanding of AI
They’re growing up in a digital world, and I want them to see technology as both a tool and a responsibility. Even now, we use simple educational apps, and as they get older, we’ll talk about how AI and other technologies work. I want them to know that these systems are created by humans and can have biases or limitations. Understanding how to navigate digital tools safely and ethically is just as important as any other life skill.

### Ethical and Moral Frameworks
As intelligent machines become more capable, questions about fairness, privacy, and responsibility will matter more than ever. As my children mature, I plan to involve them in conversations about what’s right, what’s fair, and how our actions affect others. Even at a young age, talking about why we share, why we apologize, and why we stand up for others can lay the foundation for the moral compass they’ll need in an AI-driven world.

Raising children who can adapt, think critically, empathize, create, learn continuously, understand technology, and value ethics is no small task—but I’m convinced these qualities will help my kids find their place in a world transformed by AI. It’s daunting, but it’s also an incredible opportunity. If I keep their humanity at the center of their education and development, I believe they’ll be ready for whatever the future brings.
