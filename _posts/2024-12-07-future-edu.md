As a parent of two young children—a curious four-year-old and a newborn—I often find myself reflecting on the world they’ll inherit. Working in AI and robotics research, I’m constantly reminded how profoundly the future of work, society, and even human purpose may change. Tasks that once defined entire professions—like writing contracts or managing spreadsheets—might be fully automated by the time my kids graduate from school.

While it’s impossible to predict when AGI will arrive or how it will shape our world, two extreme scenarios often come to mind:

* AGI as humanity’s omnipotent tool: In this world, AGI handles every imaginable task, making work obsolete for most people. Humans would be free to explore, create, and connect—assuming we remain in control of the technology.

* AGI as humanity’s overlord: In this dystopian scenario, AGI surpasses human control and dominates society, echoing the plot of sci-fi classics like Terminator. Survival would depend on our ability to organize, resist, and reclaim autonomy.

In both cases, general knowledge might lose its traditional value; routine tasks and even intellectual work could become the domain of AI. Only the brightest minds—perhaps the top 1%—might still be needed to design, regulate, or battle these systems. And this level of expertise often seems more innate than nurtured.

However, no matter how advanced AI becomes, certain human qualities will remain indispensable. In the first scenario, humanity’s focus would shift toward cultivating a meaningful, peaceful existence. In the second, leadership, resilience, and collaboration would be critical to survival. In either case, raising children with the right skills and values is essential.

Here are the human qualities I believe will matter most in an AI-driven future, and how I’m trying to foster them in my own kids:

## Adaptability and Resilience
The pace of change can feel overwhelming, and it will only get faster. I want my kids to feel comfortable in shifting environments, to know that it’s okay when things don’t go as planned. If they can see each new challenge as a puzzle to solve rather than a roadblock, they’ll find it easier to thrive no matter what comes their way. Sometimes that means letting a block tower fall and talking about how to rebuild it, or helping them understand that not all days feel the same, and that’s perfectly normal.

## Emotional Intelligence and Interpersonal Skills
Even the smartest machines can’t empathize. Understanding emotions, building trust, inspiring others—these are all things I see as essential in a future where humans and AI work side by side. I talk about feelings often, pointing out when one child is upset or when a kind gesture can help another person feel better. Teaching them to read social cues, communicate honestly, and care about others isn’t just good parenting—it’s preparing them for a world that still needs human warmth and understanding.

## Creativity and Original Expression
While AI can mimic patterns and styles, coming up with something truly new is still a human skill. I believe my children’s ability to imagine, create, and think differently will remain one of their greatest assets. I try to celebrate their inventive ideas—no matter how offbeat—so they understand that their unique contributions and wacky stories are valuable and worth expressing.

## Critical Thinking and Complex Problem-Solving
AI can handle vast amounts of data, but deciding what’s important, what’s ethical, and what’s truly in our best interest is still a human strength. I encourage my older child to ask questions, to look at a problem from different angles, and not to stop at the first answer he finds. Whether it’s figuring out how to share a toy so both kids stay happy or exploring why certain things in nature happen the way they do, I’m trying to lay the groundwork for a flexible, questioning mind.

## Curiosity and Lifelong Learning
Information will get outdated quickly, but the desire to learn never will. I encourage my children’s questions and do my best to feed their curiosity. We read books, explore nature, and let them dig deeper into the topics they’re fascinated by, whether it’s dinosaurs, outer space, or how a vacuum cleaner works. By showing them that new discoveries are exciting, I hope they’ll carry that love of learning throughout their lives.

## Digital Literacy and Understanding of AI
They’re growing up in a digital world, and I want them to see technology as both a tool and a responsibility. Even now, we use simple educational apps, and as they get older, we’ll talk about how AI and other technologies work. I want them to know that these systems are created by humans and can have biases or limitations. Understanding how to navigate digital tools safely and ethically is just as important as any other life skill.

## Ethical and Moral Frameworks
As intelligent machines become more capable, questions about fairness, privacy, and responsibility will matter more than ever. As my children mature, I plan to involve them in conversations about what’s right, what’s fair, and how our actions affect others. Even at a young age, talking about why we share, why we apologize, and why we stand up for others can lay the foundation for the moral compass they’ll need in an AI-driven world.

In the next [post](https://jiaming.im/2024/12/08/future-edu-guidelines.html), I'll try to come with more detailed guidelines on how to foster those human skills.
