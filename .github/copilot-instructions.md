# About this repository
This project is my personal website that hosted on GitHub Pages.
It showcases my background, academic research project (past and ongoing), blog posts, and other relevant information.
Most importantly, potential students can find information on my research interests and research opportunities. It also demonstrates success stories of my past students to attract more students to work with me.
