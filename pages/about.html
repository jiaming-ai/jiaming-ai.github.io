        <p class="narrative-text">
            My journey has been unconventional, spanning two distinct lives connected by a transformative year of reflection. In my first life, I was an entrepreneur, founding multiple startups and experiencing the acquisition of one. I learned the art of building, scaling, and the relentless pursuit of innovation in the business world.
        </p>
        <p class="narrative-text">
            Between these two chapters, I took a gap year at the University of Oxford to study theology. This wasn't an escape, but a deliberate exploration inward—seeking to understand meaning, ethics, and the questions that technology alone cannot answer. It was a period of questioning, reflection, and recalibration.
        </p>
        <p class="narrative-text">
            Today, in my second life, I'm pursuing a PhD in AI and Robotics at the National University of Singapore. My research focuses on safe, generalizable robot navigation, topological mapping under uncertainty, and vision-language interaction. I'm building systems that can understand and navigate the world with human-like reasoning, bridging the gap between perception and action.

            <p class="narrative-text">
                In my first life, I lived in the fast-paced world of startups. I founded multiple companies, each an experiment in innovation and execution. The journey was exhilarating—I learned to build products from scratch, lead teams, navigate uncertainty, and pivot when necessary. One of my ventures was acquired, a validation of the value we created. But beyond the outcomes, entrepreneurship taught me resilience, the importance of iteration, and how to turn abstract ideas into tangible impact. It was a life of doing, of moving fast, of creating in the face of ambiguity.

            <p class="narrative-text">
                After years of constant motion, I paused. I spent a gap year at the University of Oxford studying theology, not because I sought religious answers, but because I wanted to understand the deeper questions that technology and business often overlook. What does it mean to live a meaningful life? How do we construct ethical frameworks in an age of rapid technological change? This period was about introspection, about understanding the inner self, and about grounding my future work in a more profound sense of purpose. Oxford wasn't just an academic detour; it was a recalibration of values and vision.

            <p class="narrative-text">
                Now, in my second life, I've returned to building—but this time through research. As a PhD student in AI and Robotics at NUS, I work on problems at the intersection of perception, reasoning, and action. My research focuses on safe, generalizable robot navigation, developing topological mapping systems that handle uncertainty, and enabling vision-language interaction so robots can understand human intent. This isn't just about making robots smarter; it's about creating systems that can operate safely in the real world, adapt to new environments, and work alongside humans. I bring the entrepreneurial mindset of rapid prototyping and practical impact, but now grounded in rigorous research and a deeper ethical consideration of the technology we create.
